Hi guys and girls! I hope you're having a wonderful day today.
1

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:09,500
My name is Viktor and my goal is to help you understand stuff. In this course
2

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,020
my goal is to help you understand Webpack,
3

4
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:15,630
its main features, and how you can use it in your projects.
4

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:22,080
We will be talking about Webpack 4 in this course, but before going further let me first introduce myself.
5

6
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:28,250
I am a Senior Software Engineer specializing in JavaScript and various technologies around it.
6

7
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:35,270
I am creating web applications for 12 years and during this years I have learned a lot of useful stuff.
7

8
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:37,810
Now I want to share my knowledge with you.
8

9
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:43,460
Now when you already know a bit about me, let me walk you through the structure of this course.
9

10
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:47,890
At the beginning we'll create a small application with only 2 JavaScript files.
10

11
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:53,840
This application will serve us as a model on which we can apply different Webpack features and see how we can
11

12
00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:03,890
handle real world use cases. Then we will create a very basic webpack configuration for our application.
12

13
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:11,000
Then we will have a look at loaders and learn how to handle CSS, SASS, images, and other file types using
13

14
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:11,860
webpack.
14

15
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:18,290
We will also see how we can use latest cutting edge javascript features in our applications even though
15

16
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:22,150
they are not implemented in all major browsers yet.
16

17
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:28,960
After that we'll have a look at Webpack plugins and learn how we can extract all our CSS into a separate bundle.
17

18
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:35,740
We will also learn how Webpack helps us with browser caching and how we can generate HTML files automatically
18

19
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:42,680
with all the assets we need. Then we'll talk about differences between production and development builds
19

20
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:50,820
and see how we can optimize our webpack configurations. Then we'll talk about multi page applications and
20

21
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:55,400
code splitting in general. In the last section
21

22
00:01:55,430 --> 00:02:01,290
we will learn how to integrate express JS framework both for single page applications and for multiple
22

23
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,360
page applications.
23

24
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,430
It seems we have a lot to cover here.
24

25
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,710
So let's start this wonderful journey together.
