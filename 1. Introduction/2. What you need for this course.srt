00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:04,120
Let's talk about what you need in order to succeed in this course.
1

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:10,050
First you would need a computer or tablet or any other device capable of playing these videos.
2

3
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:14,810
But ideally you would need a computer or a laptop on beach you can follow these videos and repeat all
3

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,010
the actions that we are doing here.
4

5
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:23,050
You must know basics of JavaScript. JavaScript is a must here because we will do a lot of JavaScript
5

6
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:24,060
in this course.
6

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:31,620
We will not do anything complex here, but at least you must know basics. You must know basics of HTML.
7

8
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:34,840
Although we would have only a couple of HTML files here,
8

9
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:36,570
it will be very beneficial to you.
9

10
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:38,780
By the way HTML is very easy to learn.
10

11
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:43,210
I know several people who learned the basics of it during a couple of days.
11

12
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,960
This is all about musts.
12

13
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:51,720
With this you'll be able to understand most of the things in this course. Everything else is nice to have.
13

14
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:57,930
Those things will be needed if you want to understand webpack deeply and learn faster. I really encourage
14

15
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,710
you to repeat on your computer
15

16
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:01,900
everything that we will do in this course.
16

17
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:08,430
This is the best way to learn and I can really recommend it. You would need a browser. Chrome, Firefox,
17

18
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:12,450
Safari, Edge, or any other browser that can execute javascript.
18

19
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,230
By the way, Internet Explorer is also a browser.
19

20
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,880
You would need a text editor. You can use any text editor of your choice. Visual Studio Code, Atom,
20

21
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,060
Webstorm would be examples of popular editors nowadays.
21

22
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:29,100
In this videos I will be using Atom. You can download it on this Website,
22

23
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:34,990
if you decide to use it as well. If you want to follow the videos and repeat everything that we are doing
23

24
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:42,780
here, you would need to install NodeJS. You can download it from this website. NodeJS is a javascript environment
24

25
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,340
that can execute javascript code on the backend.
25

26
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:50,920
We will use NodeJS in order to run webpack in the terminal. And the last,
26

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,560
not being afraid of command line, or terminal. You shouldn't be afraid of these things.
27

28
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:02,410
Linux and Mac users have terminal installed by default in their systems and Windows users can use cmder
28

29
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:05,910
which is a console emulator for Windows.
29

30
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:09,270
You can download cmder from this website.
30

31
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,840
Basically that's all that you need in this course.
31

32
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,810
Enough introduction.
32

33
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,810
Let's proceed now to the core of the course.
