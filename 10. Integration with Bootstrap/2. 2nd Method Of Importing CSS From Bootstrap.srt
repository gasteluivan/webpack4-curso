In the previous video we have learned how to use bootstrap together with webpack.
1

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:11,910
We learned that there are two ways to include css from bootstrap into our project. We can either import pre-compiled sass
2

3
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:20,810
or import compiled and ready-to-use css. In the previous video we imported ready-to-use css.
3

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,100
So in this video I will show you how to import precompiled sass.
4

5
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:30,750
This method allows you to customize bootstrap to your needs and use the bootstrap source files as part
5

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,640
of the bundling process.
6

7
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:39,570
However, for this option to work, we need to modify our rule for scss files and install
7

8
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,570
a couple of conditional loaders.
8

9
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,480
So let's go to webpack.production.config.js
9

10
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:52,830
and do it.
10

11
00:00:52,930 --> 00:01:04,160
So now we are inside webpack configuration. And we need to modify this rule which relates to SCSS files.
11

12
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:06,990
I will align a little bit this loaders.
12

13
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:24,070
And now we need to add an additional order to our rule. This loader is called postcss loader
13

14
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:28,220
and we will put it between css loader and sass loader.
14

15
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:38,970
Here is
15

16
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:39,800
how it looks like.
16

17
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:49,640
CSS loader lets you convert modern CSS into something that most browsers can understand.
17

18
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:57,020
We can provide various plugins to postcss loader. Autoprefixer is a postcss plugin that allows
18

19
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,560
to parse CSS and add vendor prefixes to CSS rules.
19

20
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:08,940
Precss is a postcss plugin  that lets you use latest CSS features like color functions,
20

21
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:17,640
logical and custom properties, media query ranges, and image sets right now. So now we need to install
21

22
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,850
postcss loader together
22

23
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:24,000
with autoprefixer and precss. I'm going to my terminal.
23

24
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:45,640
And now I need to install these things.
24

25
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:50,680
Now we need to include sass files from Bootstrap inside our indexed.scss file.
25

26
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:54,500
And going to my editor to the index.scss file.
26

27
00:02:54,540 --> 00:03:02,470
And here right at the beginning of the file I will include the bootstrap files.
27

28
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:03,030
Yeah
28

29
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
After this is done we can go to that index.js 
29

30
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,760
And right here
30

31
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:20,550
we don't need this line anymore, so we can simply remove it. We used this line when we imported
31

32
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:23,870
ready-to-use css in the previous video.
32

33
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:31,290
We still need these lines though, because they... the first line imports javascript from Bootstrap,
33

34
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:38,920
and this line imports our index.scss  file. Let's go to the terminal and run
34

35
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,390
our build.
35

36
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:50,300
Our build is done and let's start the application.
36

37
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,570
Application is running.
37

38
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:09,630
So now we can go to our browser and check what we have there.
38

39
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,380
I will refresh my page.
39

40
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,300
And now we can see that we still have a bootstrap alert
40

41
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:24,040
at the top of the page and a dropdown component at the top right corner.
41

42
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:29,840
Everything still works even after we changed the way how we include bootstrap css into a project.
42

43
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:35,090
So in this video we have learned the second way of importing bootstrap css using webpack.
