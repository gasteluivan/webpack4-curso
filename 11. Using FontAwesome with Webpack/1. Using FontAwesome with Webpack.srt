00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:05,410
In this video we will learn how to use font awesome together with so epic.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,240
For those of you who never cared about fantasy.

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,520
This is one of the most popular item fonts on the Web.

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:15,550
These icons are used by hundreds and even thousands of Web sites.

5
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:22,090
Traditional way of including the font awesome into your Web site is to add a CDM link inside the head.

6
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:29,200
One of the students asked me recently if it's possible to install on post some as NPM package and work

7
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,140
with it the same way as it has other dependencies.

8
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:38,850
The answer is yes and in this video I will show you how in the latest version of fun awesome they introduced

9
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:44,540
SPG javascript framework using this framework is the recommended way to integrate font.

10
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:44,930
Awesome.

11
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,850
It is epic.

12
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:50,150
We need to install four different packages.

13
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:15,640
Package fun.

14
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:16,220
Awesome.

15
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:22,940
That is veggie that corn provides the core functionality of SPG javascript framework.

16
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:26,780
The other three NBN packages include font awesome icons.

17
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:35,490
Now we need to go to the editor and import this packages I will import them inside index not J S I will

18
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,790
import from awesome that SPG that core

19
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:56,020
library object allows us to specify which icons he wants to use we will use.

20
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:03,610
Don't object to replace any existing I fix these SPG as I already said we don't have to import all possible

21
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:05,320
icons from fun awesome.

22
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:12,000
We can specify only those icons which we need in our project I will import on one icon for now which

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,360
is f a spinner

24
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,420
and I will add this icon to the library

25
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:42,190
I am important on the one package which contains solid SPG icons because I don't need the other two

26
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:42,980
packages.

27
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:48,850
Obviously if you need an icon from a regular SPG icons or like icons you would need to import those

28
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:49,750
packages as well.

29
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:56,020
Now we can end this icon to our page.

30
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:12,480
I didn't go to the page template and here I will add.

31
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:19,010
I am specifying three classes here f a s means that we want to use an icon from front or some solid

32
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:27,590
items at A Dash spinner specifies the name of the icon and F A Dash spin fails the browser that this

33
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:30,100
icon should rotate.

34
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:36,130
There are five thousand different icons included in font awesome library and more than 1000 of them

35
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,700
is free of charge.

36
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:42,160
By the way we can still use IBEX in each demo.

37
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:51,220
Fun awesome library will replace this text these SPG icons but for this to happen we need to add one

38
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,490
more line to our javascript code.

39
00:03:53,510 --> 00:04:00,370
I will go to index J S and here you remember the imported DOM object.

40
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,290
Now I will use it.

41
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:09,830
Don't object as watch method and you find what this method than this method will replace any existing

42
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,570
IBEX vs SPG.

43
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:15,500
What's more it will set up an observer to continue doing this.

44
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:23,570
If it don't changes for example if B generate some 1000 icons dynamically and add them later to the

45
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:28,580
document object model they will also be replaced by assuaging.

46
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:31,630
Now let's go to the terminal and run as a process

47
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,780
and I will start the application.

48
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:45,430
Let's go to the browser and have a look at the new launching icon.

49
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:51,970
And you see this a lot in icon right here in the top left corner.

50
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:56,730
In this video if I've learned how to use one awesome together it's an epic.
