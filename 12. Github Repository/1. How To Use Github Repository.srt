00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:04,350
I have created a new Github repository for this course. In this video
1

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:06,970
I will show you how you can use this repository.
2

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,450
First of all you don't have to use it.
3

4
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:12,600
Lessons are designed to be smooth and easy to understand.
4

5
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:17,270
But if you are stuck for some reason this repository will really help you.
5

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,160
You can see the link to the repository on your screen.
6

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:30,620
If I click on this link, I will go to the github.
7

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,790
Now we need to clone this repository to our computer.
8

9
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:36,460
We need to copy this link from here.
9

10
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:46,900
And then go to the terminal. Here we need to run the following command: "git clone".
10

11
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,890
And then we paste our link that we have just copied.
11

12
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:56,840
This will create a folder with a name webpack-tutorial.
12

13
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,870
Let's go to that folder.
13

14
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:05,320
This repository
14

15
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:08,700
is all about branches.
15

16
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:14,150
There is a branch for each lesson that requires code changes. Actually there are even two branches
16

17
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,470
for each lesson.
17

18
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,010
First branch points to the beginning of the lesson.
18

19
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:21,460
It contains all the code that is needed to start the lesson.
19

20
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:27,560
The name of the branch corresponds to the name of the lesson - but with small letters and dashes -
20

21
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:34,370
and contains suffix "-begin". Second branch points to the end of the lesson.
21

22
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,820
It shows you how your project should look like at the end of that lesson.
22

23
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,950
The name of the branch corresponds to the name of the lesson.
23

24
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:46,490
But with small letters and dashes and contains suffix "-end".
24

25
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:56,600
Here you can see the naming pattern of the branches. Both branches have almost identical names but the first
25

26
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,270
one ends with "-begin"
26

27
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:02,790
and the second one ends with suffix "-end".
27

28
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:08,700
Let's assume you are about to begin the lesson "Integrating Express.js in a Single Page Application"
28

29
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:14,690
which is part of the section number 7. Then you need to checkout the branch that is pointing
29

30
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,750
to the beginning of that lesson.
30

31
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,450
Let's go to the terminal and find that branch
31

32
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:31,530
We can list all branches that exist in this repository by running the following command.
32

33
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,100
This is a pretty long list.
33

34
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:36,260
The good thing is that this list is sorted alphabetically.
34

35
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:49,810
Each branch in this list has a prefix "remotes/origin" which indicates that this branch is remote.
35

36
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:56,440
It seems that this is the branch we are looking for. It is called
36

37
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,170
"Integrating Express.js into a Single 
37

38
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:57,580
Page Application Begin".
38

39
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:04,130
In order to checkout this branch we need to run the following command.
39

40
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:15,920
I will paste the name of this branch and remove the "remote/origin" from here.
40

41
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,860
And then I will again paste the name of this branch.
41

42
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,910
But I will leave "remote/origin".
42

43
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:37,420
After we have switched to a new branch we need to run "npm install".
43

44
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:52,840
At this point
44

45
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,830
we have all the files needed to follow the lesson.
45

46
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:59,370
"Integrating Express.js in a Single Page Application".
46

47
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:04,780
If you want to see how the code should look like at the end of this lesson you can checkout another
47

48
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:13,770
branch with a similar name but with suffix "-end".  I will find this command of checking the branch
48

49
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:22,870
and here I will replace "begin" with "end". Here and here as well.
49

50
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:33,070
It may happen that you have some changes in your working directory. Then before switching a branch
50

51
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,090
You would need to discard those changes.
51

52
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,830
And then you can switch to the new branch.
52

53
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:51,250
Every time you switch to the new branch,
53

54
00:04:51,290 --> 00:05:01,030
there is a need to run "npm install".
54

55
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,160
Now you can open your editor and browse the code.
55

56
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:10,130
As I said in the beginning of this video, you don't have to repeat all these steps for every single lesson.
56

57
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:14,900
But if you're stuck in the middle of the course this repository will definitely help you.
