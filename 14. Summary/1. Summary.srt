00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:08,320
Let's do a quick recap or what we have done so far.
2

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,270
First we created a small application with only two javascript files.
3

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:18,230
Then we integrated webpack into our application.
4

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:25,290
Then we looked at the webpack loaders and learned how to import CSS, images, and lots of other stuff into
5

6
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:26,820
our application.
6

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:33,240
we also have seen how we can use latest cutting edge javascript features in our applications, even though
7

8
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,560
they are not implemented in all major browsers yet.
8

9
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:45,220
After that we looked at several webpack plugins and learned how to extract css into a separate bundle, and
9

10
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,620
how to generate html files.
10

11
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:53,490
We talked about browser caching and how webpack can help us with that.
11

12
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:59,130
Then we talked about the differences between production and development builds and optimized our webpack
12

13
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,740
configurations for these use cases.
13

14
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:09,440
We also talked about multi-page applications and how we can handle common dependencies between several
14

15
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,000
pages.
15

16
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:19,580
Finally, we learned how to integrate express.js framework both for single page applications and for multi-page
16

17
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:21,910
applications.
17

18
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:24,860
It was a nice journey and we had a lot of fun together.

19
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:29,690
I hope you enjoyed watching this course as much as I enjoyed creating it.

00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,540
Have a nice day and a happy life.
