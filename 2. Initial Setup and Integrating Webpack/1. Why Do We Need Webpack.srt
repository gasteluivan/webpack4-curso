In this video we will think about Why. Why do we need Webpack at all?
1

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:09,250
Back in the days when dinosaurs were walking on Earth and nobody heard about an iPhone,
2

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,850
web applications look like this.
3

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:17,190
Here we can see that several CSS files are included at the top of the HTML file. But that is not the
4

5
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,540
first thing here.
5

6
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:21,130
Do you see how many JavaScript files we have here?
6

7
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:26,230
Eleven! Eleven! And some of them depend on each other!
7

8
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:31,080
Of course it is easy to tell that almost everything probably depends on the common.js because of
8

9
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,420
its name. But would you guess in the first 5 minutes
9

10
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:40,190
that's the shipping.js depends on user.js  because user.js handles the address of the customer?
10

11
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:44,300
If you accidentally change the order of the JavaScript files,
11

12
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:48,190
this project might break. When I only started my career,
12

13
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:55,630
all that applications look like this. But then we started to use grunt and gulp. These tools helped us to
13

14
00:00:55,630 --> 00:01:00,970
manage assets and  concatenate all our JavaScript files into one. But they still can't figure out
14

15
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:02,880
dependencies between those files.
15

16
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:09,560
In order to manage JavaScript dependencies we used require.js which helps in a way. But it is
16

17
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:15,220
not as powerful as Webpack. Webpack is a static module bundler for modern javascript applications.
17

18
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:20,420
When Webpack processes your application, it recursively builds a dependency graph that includes every
18

19
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:26,500
module in your application. And then packages all of those modules into one or more bundles.
19

20
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:31,540
When I started using Webpack, most of my projects started to look like this.
20

21
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:37,280
There are only 2 files here: 1 file for CSS and 1 file for JavaScript.
21

22
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,420
There are no hidden dependencies.
22

23
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,990
You don't have to worry about the correct order of the files anymore.
23

24
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,140
There is only one JavaScript file we need to include! All dependencies, internal and external, are bundled
24

25
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,440
inside this file.
25

26
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:55,100
Basically, Webpack is a single tool for managing all of your code as well as assets in 1 place. It can
26

27
00:01:55,100 --> 00:02:02,740
handle javascript, typescript, coffeescript, CSS, SASS, LESS, images, and so much more! In 3 words, Webpack
27

28
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:07,280
is all in one. I think by this point you already know why we need Webpack.
28

29
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,140
Let's go further and learn how to use it.
