00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:06,150
In this video we are going to create a basic setup for the future videos.

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,120
We want to touch what back yet.

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,910
So if you like you can skip to the next video.

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:20,800
We are going to create a simple project with only three files one HDMI file and two JavaScript files.

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:28,560
I've already created an empty folder for our project called tutorial and I opened this empty folder

6
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,300
in a text editor.

7
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:39,560
Basically you can use any editor of a choice like visual studio called Web storm sublime text etc..

8
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:45,920
First I'm going to create an HD email file with the name index that HDMI

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:04,750
I will paste here a simple content that I prepared beforehand.

10
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:10,360
This is a very simple HDMI page nothing special is going on here.

11
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:18,090
I am specifying a title character set which is UTF eight inside the body tag.

12
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:24,710
I am including two JavaScript files that we don't have at the moment but I'm going to grade them right

13
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,040
now.

14
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:33,830
I'm going to put these files into a separate folder called that's ever seen so I need to create this

15
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:34,210
folder.

16
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:34,580
Now

17
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:46,030
first I'm going to create Hello World dot J S file

18
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:58,520
there will be only one function here called Hello World.

19
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:01,220
This will be a pretty basic function.

20
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:05,510
It will print a simple string Hello World to the browser console

21
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:10,030
the function is done.

22
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:17,030
Let's invoke this function you're going to invoke it from another file that I'm going to create right

23
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,970
now.

24
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:27,650
This file will have a name index that J S so I will invoke the hello world function from here

25
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,270
as you can see the function definition is located inside.

26
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:55,620
Hello World dot J S file and we invoke this function from a different file index that J as in other

27
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,310
words index that Jesus file depends on.

28
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,670
Hello World note J S file

29
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,890
let's have a look how it works in the browser Heigl copy it it will pass and go to the browser

30
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:21,790
I don't paste of this pass to the navigation bar and currently we have an empty page here but if I go

31
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:29,890
to the developer tools and have a look in the console top you will see a jealous script error saying

32
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:36,750
hello world is not defined at index that G S so why do you think we have this error

33
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:47,650
if I go back to the editor and have a look at index dot J S file I you'll see the function invocation

34
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:52,490
here however the browser says that it's not defined.

35
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:56,520
Actually the issue is not connected to this file.

36
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:06,270
The issue is connected to HDMI all file these these two script tags you see index that Jesus is included

37
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:15,020
before hello world that J S however it should be included after because inside the index that Jesus

38
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:24,760
you are using a function that's defined inside hello world that J S here we are using hello world function

39
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:36,370
and here this function is defined therefore the order of this lines is wrong I need to change the order

40
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:45,580
I need to put index that Jesus after hello world not J S so as a function declaration comes before the

41
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:55,820
function invocation let's have a look at the browser again and check if everything works now I refresh

42
00:04:55,820 --> 00:05:01,670
in my page and now we see hello world string in the browser console.

43
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:08,530
So basically we are done is our set up they're going to use it in the future read years in the next

44
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:12,000
video they're going to integrate right back into our project.
