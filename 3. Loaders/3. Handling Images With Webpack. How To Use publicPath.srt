00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:04,690
So we need to tell Webpack in which location our image is located.
1

2
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:10,950
We can see that it is inside the dist folder. This file is actually our image.
2

3
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:15,750
It has some strange name because it is an MD5 hash, but it is still our image.
3

4
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,840
We need to add 1 more property to the output configuration option.
4

5
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:27,770
This property is named publicPath.
5

6
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,420
And we need to specify dist here, because our image is inside the dist folder.
6

7
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:40,690
Don't forget the ending slash.
7

8
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:45,090
Now let's run Webpack in the terminal and see if anything changes in the browser.
8

9
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,540
Our build is done.
9

10
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,420
So I'm going to my browser and I will refresh my page. And voila!
10

11
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,980
Now we can see that our image is on the page.
11

12
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:03,090
And if you look into the developer tools you'll see that our image src begins with "dist/"
12

13
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:06,290
and then the MD5 hash.
13

14
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:13,490
So basically publicPath tells Webpack where all the generated files are located. Let's assume that
14

15
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:19,730
we deployed this website to the Internet and we have registered a domain 
15

16
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:20,690
"http://the-most-awesome-website.com/".
16

17
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:27,280
So in order to correctly show images on this domain we would need to change the publicPath
17

18
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:29,120
"http://the-most-awesome-website.com/"
18

19
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:30,910
Let's play with it a bit.
19

20
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:38,210
So here inside the dist I will put "http://the-most-awesome-website.com/"
20

21
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:48,670
Because when I Webpack creates the path to the file it will just concatenate
21

22
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:55,640
these two strings. So it will be the domain name and then slash and then file name.
22

23
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:59,810
So now let's go to the terminal and run our build again.
23

24
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:10,590
Our build is done and we can go to the browser again, and refresh the page, and you cannot see the image
24

25
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:18,240
here because I changed the public path. But here inside the developer tools you can see that src starts
25

26
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:25,180
with "http://the-most-awesome-website.com/" and then the filename.
26

27
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:31,120
In this video we have successfully imported an image into the javascript file and became familiar with Webpack loaders.
