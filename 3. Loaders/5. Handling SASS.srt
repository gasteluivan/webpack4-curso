In the previous video we have learned how to import CSS files inside our JavaScript.
1

2
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:13,220
By the way we can also write our styles using SASS or LESS as well as other CSS preprocessors.
2

3
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:18,380
I will show you how to import sass here, but you can easily use anything you want in your application.
3

4
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:23,500
Let's go to our editor again and change our css into sass.
4

5
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:28,790
First I would change file extension into scss and then I would use some variables for font size and
5

6
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:29,150
color.
6

7
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:54,710
We will play a bit and change text color to red. Don't forget to change the import statement on the
7

8
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:59,800
javascript side.
8

9
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:07,330
Now we need to create a rule for sass files. I copy this rule for css and slightly modify it.
9

10
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,280
we need to add sass loader to the end of the chain.
10

11
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,770
Pay attention to the order in which loaders appear in the array.
11

12
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,670
Webpack processes loaders from right to left.
12

13
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:31,100
So first Webpack will invoke sass loader which will convert our sass to css. And it will invoke
13

14
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:37,670
css-loader which will take that converted css and convert it to the javascript representation. 
14

15
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:43,100
And only then Webpack will invoke style-loader which will create style tags inside our HTML page and
15

16
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,970
put the assets into it.
16

17
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:48,020
Since we are using a new loader we have to install it
17

18
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:00,960
So you guys need to run this command.
18

19
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:08,090
I have already run this command before and I have sass loader installed, and this command takes some time.
19

20
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:13,090
Now let's run Webpack again and go to browser and check if everything still works.
20

21
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:25,990
I will refresh my page and make several clicks and we have red text there.
21

22
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,700
So yes it works!
22

23
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,580
Congratulations!
23

24
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,610
In this video we have successfully learned how to import scss into our Javascript.
