In this section we are going to learn about Webpack plugins. A plugin is a Javascript library that adds functionality

00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,650
to the Webpack itself.

00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:12,570
Plugins can do everything that loaders cannot do.

00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:18,510
We use loaders for example when we need to import different files. When we need to import css files,

00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:23,590
we use css loader, and when we need to import xml files, we use xml loader.

00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:29,920
But what if you need to do something else than importing a new type of file? With plugins

00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,090
we can do much more.

00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:34,960
We can define global constants across the whole project.

00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:40,670
We can minify our resulting bundle so it consumes less space and is faster to download.

00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,440
We can also generate new files, other than the bundle.js.

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:51,420
Webpack itself is built on the same plugin system that we can use in our Webpack configuration.

In the next video

00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,690
We will have a look at a plugin that can minify our resulting bundle.
