00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:10,630
So let's go to the text editor and look inside the generated styles.css.
1

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,050
Here is all our css from the whole application.
2

3
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:17,600
Currently our application consists only of one component.
3

4
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:18,560
Hello world
4

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:18,980
Button.
5

6
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,550
Let's create another component
6

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:29,700
with some styles and check if all the css from both components goes into
7

8
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:34,040
styles.css file. We'll create a component named Heading.
8

9
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:38,480
So now I will create a Heading directory inside the components directory,
9

10
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,730
and inside this directory I will create a new
10

11
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:49,320
file.
11

12
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:49,710
Heading
12

13
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,080
.js
13

14
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,230
Let's create a new class for our component.
14

15
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:04,470
This class
15

16
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:07,010
will have only one method called render.
16

17
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:37,110
This method will create an H1 element and insert it into the body element.
17

18
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:39,990
I will put some text inside H1.
18

19
00:01:49,760 --> 00:02:01,460
And I will add this H1 element to the body.
19

20
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,700
Now we need to export this class.
20

21
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:16,240
Okay, our new component is finished.
21

22
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:21,110
And what I'd like to do now, is import our styles at the top of the file.
22

23
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:26,320
We don't have any styles for this component yet, but we'll create them in a moment.
23

24
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,920
Let's create a new file for our styles.
24

25
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:58,390
I created this file inside the same directory as the javascript file. This file will be very simple.
25

26
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,210
We'll just set a color of an H1  element.
26

27
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,440
I will put "gray" here.
27

28
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:13,630
It will be enough for this example.
28

29
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:17,020
Now let's import our new component inside
29

30
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:17,920
index.js.
30

31
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:42,200
We need to create an instance of the Heading component and then call the render method.
31

32
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,310
Let's run the build process and have a look at the dist folder.
32

33
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:13,900
I'm going back to my editor and open styles.css 
33

34
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:23,900
And here we can see that css for both our components is inside.
34

35
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:33,140
These styles correspond to the Hello World Button component, and these two lines correspond to the heading component.
35

36
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:40,780
In other words MiniCssExtractPlugin extracts all our styles from the application and puts them
36

37
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,740
inside a single css file under the dist folder.
37

38
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:47,280
Now let's check our application in the browser.
38

39
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:58,780
I refreshed my page in the browser and we got a new heading here which says " Webpack is awesome",
39

40
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,800
which is pretty much true. In this video
40

41
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:05,400
We learned how to extract our css into a separate file.
