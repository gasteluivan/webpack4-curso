In the previous video we learned how to generate the html file automatically during each build. In this

00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:09,360
video
2

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:12,120
We are going to learn how to customize this file.
3

4
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:19,830
In particular we are going to pass custom options to it. If you look carefully at the generated file, you
4

5
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,000
will notice that Webpack changed the page title.
5

6
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:26,680
Earlier
6

7
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:30,910
the title was hello world and now it is Webpack app.
7

8
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,860
We want our title back and there is a way to get it back.
8

9
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:46,410
Let's go to the Webpack configuration.
9

10
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,490
Here we can pass additional options
10

11
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:52,180
to this plugin. For example we can specify a custom title
11

12
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:01,820
Actually,
12

13
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:03,870
we can customize more things.
13

14
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:12,560
We can also specify the name of the generated file and provide additional meta tags. Let's specify
14

15
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:13,760
a custom file name.
15

16
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:25,520
By the way,
16

17
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,040
we can also specify a subfolder here.
17

18
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:42,160
This tells Webpack to create a subfolder in the dist folder and put the html file inside this subfolder.
18

19
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,440
Let's provide an additional meta tag.
19

20
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:01,790
This tells Webpack to add a description meta tag to the page.
20

21
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:12,370
Let's run the build process and check if anything changes.
21

22
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,920
Let's go back to the text editor.
22

23
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:24,470
As you can see now we have a subfolder inside the dist folder and inside this subfolder there is
23

24
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,500
our html file.
24

25
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:35,490
It has our own title which is hello world and our own description which is some description.
25

26
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:47,190
Let's leave the filename as it was by default. I will remove the filename from options.
26

27
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,700
There are more options you can customize.
27

28
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:53,470
All these options are listed on the Github page of this plugin.
28

29
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,120
If you scroll down you will see the list of options
29

30
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:00,960
you can customize.
30

31
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:08,760
This is a list of options. It's quite big.
31

32
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:17,640
By the way you can even provide your own template for the html file.
32

33
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:23,270
This way you can fully customize how it looks. In the next video you'll see how you can do it.
