00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:09,490
In this video we're going to create our own template for generating html files.
1

2
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:13,630
First of all we need to decide which template engine we are going to use.
2

3
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:22,710
There are plenty of template engines out there. You can use pug, ejs, underscore, handlebars and
3

4
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:23,580
so on.
4

5
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,370
All of them will give you similar results.
5

6
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,530
Which one to use is just a matter of personal preference.
6

7
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,970
I like handlebars the most.
7

8
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,620
So in this course we are going to use handlebars
8

9
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:45,170
handlebars is a template engine for javascript that allows you to separate the business logic from presentation.
9

10
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:51,260
If you find yourself generating html inside your javascript then you probably need some kind
10

11
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,910
of template engine.
11

12
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,980
Let's create our first handlebars template.
12

13
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,750
We are going to create this template inside the src folder.
13

14
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:13,850
hbs is
14

15
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:23,140
an extension for handlebars templates. I will copy the html markup from the generated html file
15

16
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:24,250
and put it here.
16

17
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:32,660
Let's improve formatting
17

18
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,020
a bit.
18

19
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:54,100
We also need to remove the references to the bundles.
19

20
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:03,430
Webpack will add these references automatically during the build process.
20

21
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:10,370
The names of the generated files will be different each time because we are using md5 hash
21

22
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,060
in the bundle name.
22

23
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:18,800
You can put everything you need inside this handlebars file. Webpack will use it as a template while generating
23

24
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:22,580
an html file during the build process.
24

25
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:29,210
In our case I will leave the template as it is, but I'll change the title and description in order to
25

26
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:30,310
use handlebars
26

27
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:50,450
variables.
27

28
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:53,220
This is the handlebars variable.
28

29
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,910
We'll assign this variable in the Webpack configuration.
29

30
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:14,400
I will also put the handlebars variable instead of the title.
30

31
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:22,970
Now let's tell Webpack to use our template while generating the html file. I will go to the Webpack configuration.
31

32
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:31,430
And here you I will pass a new option which is called template.
32

33
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:45,160
Here I specified to path to the file that we just created.
33

34
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,470
We also need to provide the description variable.
34

35
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:51,290
It should be specified on the same level as title.
35

36
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:01,910
Webpack will take handlebars variables from here and here.
36

37
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,670
Since we are using a new type of file here,
37

38
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:13,150
HBS, we need to teach Webpack how to handle this type of file.
38

39
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:32,760
We are going to use a new loader here which is called handlebars loader.
39

40
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,990
And since we are using a new loader we need to install it.
40

41
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:01,160
We also need to install handlebars package itself.
41

42
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:13,280
Let's run the build process and see what happens.
42

43
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,220
It seems everything works fine.
43

44
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:26,100
Let's go check the dist folder.
44

45
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:36,070
We still have index.html inside the dist folder. Let's look inside. This time Webpack used our own
45

46
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,610
template for generating this file.
46

47
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:54,160
Let's have a look at it in the browser.
47

48
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,030
It seems everything  still works.
48

49
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,210
Congratulations!
49

50
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:02,820
In this video we learned how to tell Webpack to use our own template while generating html.
