1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:04,170
In this video people talk about mode option.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:10,620
Remember in our back configuration if a special option called mode this option enables certain things

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:14,580
in optimizations for production deals and development bills.

4
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:18,360
By the way the mode option became available starting from.

5
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:26,060
For earlier versions of required much more configuration in order to get the same results in the beginning

6
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:30,010
of this course we have set this option to num.

7
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,960
It means that we don't want any kind of built in optimizations.

8
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,350
Now it's time to change the setting.

9
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:41,760
We can put here three different entities non development or production.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,370
Let's add more option two different variables and compare what happens with our bundles.

11
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,280
First let's set it to production

12
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:57,520
production mode enables quite a long list of different plugins including some plugin.

13
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:03,380
If you want to see the full list of plugins you can go to the official web backed documentation to this

14
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:03,740
page

15
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,040
and here you can find the full list of plugins.

16
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:16,000
The mode option also sets process and not and variable to production.

17
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:22,590
We can use this variable in our code to check if they are in production mode or in development mode.

18
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:26,450
Let's go to index not J S now and see how it works

19
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:35,870
I will add a little bit of code here that will check note and variable

20
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:48,760
note and variable equal to production legal output to the console.

21
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,820
Production mode.

22
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,310
And if this variable equals 2 development we will output to the console development mode.

23
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:18,190
Production and development mode also handle errors difference.

24
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,700
Let's make some intentional error here.

25
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:31,570
Real cold metal that does not exist.

26
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:34,220
Now we need to run our build in the terminal.

27
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,890
Let's go to the browser and look into the browser console.

28
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,660
I can copy the full POS to our index HDMI out.

29
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,660
And paste it into the browser

30
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,100
in the browser console.

31
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:08,810
We can see that we are in production mode and that we had an error because all our javascript code is

32
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:11,210
bundled inside the one file and modified.

33
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:20,270
We just see that this error comes somewhere from bundle the J S from line 1 if we click on this line

34
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:24,310
then we'll go to that magnified version of our code.

35
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:27,900
It is very hard to understand any sum here.

36
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:31,490
Now let's change the mode auction to development and run our event.

37
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:31,900
Again

38
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:40,800
now we need to go to the terminal and front our built

39
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:54,850
so let's go to the browser and check the page one more time.

40
00:03:54,870 --> 00:04:00,550
Now we can see that we are in development mode and that we have an error coming specifically from index

41
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:05,230
J S from line 16 if I click on this line.

42
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:12,870
I will go to the readable version of our source files does this specific line end here.

43
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,800
I can see that the accounting method does not exist.

44
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,710
This is already much better.

45
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:23,100
This works because development mode uses source maps by default.

46
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:28,550
In this video we have seen how we can use smart option for optimizing our production and development

47
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:28,970
yields.
