00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:07,390
In the previous video video and how we can use mullet auction in order to change what behavior for production

2
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:08,890
and development builds.

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:15,610
First we changed the mold auction indirect configuration to production and then to development following

4
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:21,190
this practice we would need to set mold auction to development while developing our application and

5
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:22,670
change it to production.

6
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:27,220
Every time we want to deploy the application this is not very convenient.

7
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:33,160
In this video I will show you how to manage effectively different configurations for production and

8
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:40,720
development deals we can create two separate configuration files one for production builds and one for

9
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,310
development builds.

10
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:45,940
So we name our PAC not contact the J.

11
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:50,920
S to let the production the conflict that J S

12
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:03,080
and you also create one more file.

13
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:06,170
What that that the quantity the J.

14
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:06,560
S

15
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:19,720
or now I do copy everything from the production configuration into this file

16
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:28,370
however we need to adjust these configurations.

17
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:35,840
Let's adjust our production configuration really to set mold auction to production.

18
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:45,140
We can safely remove to support in the cost in production mode.

19
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:54,870
This plugin is included by default you can also remove a set of plugin from imports everyone else in

20
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:57,090
this file is suitable for production.

21
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:01,360
So our production configuration was built.

22
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:05,810
Now let's go to the development configuration and remove everything that you don't need.

23
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:13,560
When you put change multifunction to development and it is a lot of development.

24
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:22,540
So now we need to remove content from here because we don't need to handle other occasions during development.

25
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:30,990
We can also remove our surplus from London's every because they don't need to modify our code during

26
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:35,050
development and also remove it from imports.

27
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:41,500
Here you don't need to extract all our sea assets into a separate file as well.

28
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,920
So I will remove this USS extra one from here.

29
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:59,110
And from here you also need to replace this one in the rules and I will replace this style order

30
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,890
all this changes should make our development faster.

31
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:13,270
It won't notice any difference in our small application but in bigger applications the difference can

32
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:14,200
be significant.

33
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:21,220
Since we now get two different configuration files it also need the ability to run them separately.

34
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:27,130
This can be easily done using NPM scripts so I'll go to the package Jason File

35
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:38,080
and here we have our streets and for now the arbitration panel in one script which is built I will continue

36
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:41,380
using this script for production purposes.

37
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,650
So here I need to specify our production configuration

38
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,720
and I'll create one more script

39
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:08,980
but here I will specify the development configuration.

40
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:11,560
Now let's check these two NPM scripts.

41
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,780
I don't go to the terminal

42
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:21,810
production but it works fine.

43
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,410
Let's now check development build

44
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,140
development build.

45
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,450
Also works fine.

46
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:35,420
So in this video we have created two separate configurations for production and development.

47
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:41,520
At this point we have fully fledged configurations specifically targeting single page application.
