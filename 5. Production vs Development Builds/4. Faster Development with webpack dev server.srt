In the previous video we created two separate configurations for development and production builds.
1

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:11,130
We did it because our development build should have another settings that the production build, in order
2

3
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,300
to work faster. While developing new features,
3

4
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:19,320
we want to spend as little time as we can waiting for our code to build.
4

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:25,570
Ideally we want to see our changes in the browser instantly, even without rebuilding stuff.
5

6
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,830
I have a good news for you guys and girls.
6

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,000
We can make it happen!
7

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:35,530
And in this video I'll show you how. We will need to install webpack-dev-server NPM package.
8

9
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:57,470
It provides all the things we need. So we are going to the terminal now and installing webpack-dev-server.
9

10
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,270
Now we need to specify options for the dev server.
10

11
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:04,120
We can just go to our development config and add a couple of lines there.
11

12
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,830
I'm going to webpack.dev.config.
12

13
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:22,260
And here I will add a new option called devServer.
13

14
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:30,300
This is an object and inside we need to specify three options. First one is content base,
14

15
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:39,150
and it should point to our dist folder as an absolute path.
15

16
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:48,680
So I can copy the absolute path from here and paste it here. It will be the same.
16

17
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:58,330
The next option is index and here we need to specify the name of the index.html file.
17

18
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:06,430
So in our case its index.html. And the third option will be port on which this webpack-dev-server will
18

19
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:13,050
be running. I will put 9000 here.
19

20
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,580
Now we need to change our NPM script for development build so it will use webpack-dev-server.
20

21
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,030
I will go to the package.json
21

22
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:29,200
and here I can see our development script. So I will replace it with a webpack-dev-server.
22

23
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,460
Here instead of webpack I will write webpack-dev-server
23

24
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:43,610
and at the end of this command I will write --hot. And that's it!
24

25
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,250
Let's run our development build and see what happens.
25

26
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:50,780
I will go to the terminal and run npm run dev.
26

27
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:08,400
So the build is ready. And webpack said that project is running at the http://localhost:9000. So I will
27

28
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,980
open this URL in the browser.
28

29
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,600
And here we have our page.
29

30
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:37,320
I will now put my browser and my editor on one screen side by side.
30

31
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,920
Now let's change something in the index.js.
31

32
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:51,210
I will create a second page here.
32

33
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:52,700
Just copy this two lines
33

34
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:59,120
And change the variable into heading2.
34

35
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,890
So I have created the second heading now.
35

36
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,400
And the magic begins.
36

37
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,080
I am saving this file and...
37

38
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:14,070
you saw it!?
38

39
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:20,420
We got an updated version in our browser instantly! without running webpack in the terminal!
39

40
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,860
Pure magic!
40

41
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:24,340
We can do the same with our css.
41

42
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:28,590
I will go to the hello-world-button styles and change the color of the button.
42

43
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:37,580
Now I'm inside hello-world-button.scss file, and I want to change button background color
43

44
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,350
to red.
44

45
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,700
And I am saving the file...
45

46
00:04:54,470 --> 00:05:01,140
You saw it again!? It works instantly! In this video we have learned how to get our changes in the browser without
46

47
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:04,750
manually running webpack, and also  have seen some magic.
