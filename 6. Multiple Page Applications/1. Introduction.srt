Until this moment we have used webpack in order to take all our modules and put them together into
1

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:07,900
a single bundle js file.
2

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,130
As a result this bundle JS contains all our javascript code.
3

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:16,570
This approach is widely used when there is a need to create a single page application.
4

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,050
But this is not the only usage of Webpack. In some projects
5

6
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:26,130
we need to have more than one html page. Especially if these pages are rendered on the server side
6

7
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:31,780
Then most probably server sends different pages to the browser depending on the url that you write
7

8
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,350
in the navigation bar.
8

9
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:39,800
Like for example if we go to our Hello World page, then we see our hello world button.
9

10
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:44,320
And if we go to a separate kiwi page, we'll see our Kiwi image.
10

11
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,420
Remember? we imported this image early at the beginning of this course.
11

12
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,890
By the way, this two pages may also have something in common.
12

13
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,300
For example lodash library.
13

14
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,120
Then we need to find out how to handle this common dependencies as well.
14

15
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:05,680
In this section we'll learn how to split our javascript code into multiple bundles and create multiple
15

16
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,740
html files for different pages of our website.
