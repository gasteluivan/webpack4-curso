00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:03,940
Let's imagine that our Website should consist of two pages.
1

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,020
One is a hello world page which we already have.
2

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:09,480
And the second one is kiwi page which we have just seen in the previous video.
3

4
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:15,430
Our second page would need a new component which would add a kiwi image to the page. In this video
4

5
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:17,380
we will create this component.
5

6
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:21,820
All it will do is just add our kiwi image to the body DOM element.
6

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,110
We will create a new folder inside the components folder for our new component.
7

8
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,840
I will name this folder kiwi image
8

9
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:47,030
And I will move the kiwi image that we already have to this new folder.
9

10
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,050
Now we need to create the component itself.
10

11
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,050
So I will create a new JavaScript file
11

12
00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:00,370
I will also name it kiwi image dot js.
12

13
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:14,080
And inside this file we will create our kiwi image component. So I will create a new class.
13

14
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:19,280
And this class will have only one function inside which is render.
14

15
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:29,190
Inside this function we will create our image element and then add it to the body DOM element.
15

16
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:49,180
I will add src to this image element. It should be a path to our kiwi image.
16

17
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:53,810
For this we would need to import our image into this file.
17

18
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:10,160
And now I can use Kiwi as an src.
18

19
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:13,630
We would also put an alt attribute here.
19

20
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:33,540
And I will add a class , css class to this element, because we would need to do some styling.
20

21
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:38,490
Now we already have our image element.
21

22
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:58,200
What we need to do now is to add this element to the existing body DOM element of our page.
22

23
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:03,030
OK it seems we are done now.
23

24
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:07,750
We need to export our kiwi image class from this file.
24

25
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:12,400
So later we can import it inside our new Page
25

26
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:18,920
I missed a space here.
26

27
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,260
This component who also has some css.
27

28
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:29,300
So we will add it as well. Inside our Kiwi image folder
28

29
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:33,470
I will create yet another file which he'll be called
29

30
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,680
kiwi image dot scss.
30

31
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,620
And inside this file I will add some simple css to our image.
31

32
00:03:52,250 --> 00:04:02,070
I will specify display block and I will specify some specific width for our component, so it wouldn't be very
32

33
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:02,610
big.
33

34
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:09,000
Like for example 400 pixels and also I will put height auto.
34

35
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:19,380
Now we need to import this css file inside the main component file, so I will go to
35

36
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:25,920
kiwi image dot js. And right  below the importing our image
36

37
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,050
i will import css as well.
37

38
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:41,890
It seems our component is ready now. In the next video we will create a page that will use this component.
