00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:07,330
In this video we will learn how to create two separate javascript bundles instead of one. In our future videos
1

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:12,630
we'll include the first javascript bundle on the hello world page and the second javascript bundle on
2

3
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:13,590
kiwi page.
3

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,690
So let's create our second page.
4

5
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:19,640
We will reuse our kiwi image component that we created in the previous video.
5

6
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:27,040
So now I will create a new script file for our kiwi page
6

7
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:31,930
and I'll name it
7

8
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:32,930
kiwi.js.
8

9
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,330
This Javascript file to present our second page,
9

10
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,380
kiwi page.
10

11
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:46,630
It will look almost the same as the hello world page, but instead with the kiwi component inside.
11

12
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,630
So let's create it.
12

13
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,260
First let's import heading,
13

14
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:56,930
because on this page we will also have heading.
14

15
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,750
And now let's create an instance of our heading component and render it.
15

16
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:20,550
Besides heading
16

17
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,200
we also need our kiwi image component which we just created in the previous video.
17

18
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:26,310
So let's import it.
18

19
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:41,540
okay.
19

20
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:44,510
And now we need to instantiate it and to render it.
20

21
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:00,550
cool.
21

22
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,980
It seems this page is ready. 
22

23
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:17,120
Let's also rename our existing index.js file into hello-world.js.
23

24
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:22,430
Now we have two different JavaScript files that basically represent two different entry points that
24

25
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:25,520
should be included inside two different html pages.
25

26
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,210
Let's tell webpack to create two separate javascript bundles out of these two files.
26

27
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,930
We need to go to 
27

28
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:33,440
webpack.production config.js.
28

29
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:39,920
And here we need to change something in our entry.
29

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,830
Basically we'll split this one file into two files so what we need to do is to replace this string with
30

31
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:52,880
a javascript object. Inside this object we will have two properties.
31

32
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:55,950
First one would be hello world
32

33
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:03,230
and it will point to the hello world file.
33

34
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:11,730
And the second property would be named kiwi.
34

35
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:18,310
And it will point to our kiwi.js file that he just created.
35

36
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,470
Since we have two entry points instead of one,
36

37
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,950
now we need to specify somehow that their names should be different.
37

38
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:37,480
With current configuration both of them will be named bundle.js.
38

39
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:44,370
Of course they will have content hash inside but it would be nice if we name it something different
39

40
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,860
that bundle.js. For example,
40

41
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:48,060
hello-world.js and kiwi.js.
41

42
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:59,580
So for this we just need to replace this bundle with a [name]. Like this.
42

43
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:09,360
So webpack will just take the name of the property from the entry point configuration option and put it
43

44
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,200
here.
44

45
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:18,000
And for the second file it will take other property and put it here.
45

46
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,000
By the way we can do the same trick for css files.
46

47
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,330
We just need to go to the mini-css-extract-plugin configuration and change the file name to
47

48
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:28,710
something very similar.
48

49
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:33,900
So we will also use [name] there.
49

50
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:43,140
Let's go to our configuration and change... inside this string we will change styles to be [name].
50

51
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:53,090
So let's run webpack now and check what we get after that in our dist folder.
51

52
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:54,220
Let's go to the terminal
52

53
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,950
And run npm run build.
53

54
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,320
it seems our build is done.
54

55
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:11,980
Let's go to our editor now and have a look at our dist folder.
55

56
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:21,670
We see that now we have two different JavaScript files inside our dist folder. One is called hello-world.<something>.js
56

57
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:26,840
and another one called kiwi.<something>.js.
57

58
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:32,890
And we also have two different css files. In this video
58

59
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:35,690
we have learned how to split our code into multiple bundles.
