In the previous video we have learned how to split our javascript code into multiple bundles.
1

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:11,310
But if you run webpack now, you will see that all our bundles are included inside one html file which
2

3
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:12,850
is index.html.
3

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:22,390
Let's check it. I run my build now. I will go to the editor and check our dist folder.
4

5
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:25,910
And here we have index.html.
5

6
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:31,590
And if I open it, I clearly see that all our javascript bundles
6

7
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,280
hello-world.js
7

8
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:42,990
and kiwi.js are included inside this single file. And the same with css files. Both of them are here.
8

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,210
However, we would need to generate two different html pages if we need proper multiple page
9

10
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:57,110
application. One page would be Hello World page and the other one would be kiwi html page.
10

11
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:03,290
In this video we will learn how we can generate multiple html files and include different bundles inside different
11

12
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,510
html files.
12

13
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,040
Let's go to our Webpack production config.
13

14
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,910
And check our configuration for the  HtmlWebpackPlugin.
14

15
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:21,730
I'm going down to the plugins array and I see here
15

16
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:23,320
Our HtmlWebpackPlugin.
16

17
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:29,450
But if we want to generate 2 html files, we need to include HtmlWebpackPlugin twice in the
17

18
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,410
plugins array.
18

19
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:41,680
So I will add a second instance of this plugin here.
19

20
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:46,300
Now we need to differentiate between the two instances of HtmlWebpackPlugin.
20

21
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:54,640
The best solution here is to provide different file names. Our first instance would have a file name
21

22
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,110
hello-world.html.
22

23
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:13,480
And title would be hello world, description would still be hello world, and template...
23

24
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:21,170
We are using an index.hbs here, but I think we need to rename it, because it's no longer index anymore.
24

25
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:29,990
So I will just rename it to something more generic like page-template.hbs.
25

26
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:33,640
And here
26

27
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:38,140
I will also use page-template.hbs.
27

28
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:43,070
So now we need to adjust to the second instance of HtmlWebpackPlugin.
28

29
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,480
Also provide a filename
29

30
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:44,850
here.
30

31
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:59,540
And it will be kiwi.html, and Title I will change to "Kiwi". And the same with description. I will
31

32
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:00,680
also use here
32

33
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:03,420
page-template.hbs as a template.
33

34
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:07,280
Cool.
34

35
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:15,010
But now how do we know which bundles to include in this file name, in the hello-world.html,
35

36
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,800
and which bundles include inside kiwi.html?
36

37
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:24,970
HtmlWebpackPlugin has a special option here called chunks where we can specify which bundles
37

38
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:28,740
exactly we would need to include inside this html page.
38

39
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:36,710
So I will add these configuration options here. Chunks and this is an array, so actually you can specify
39

40
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:45,380
multiple chunks, not only one. But in our case we need the only one chunk now which is hello world
40

41
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:51,790
n this example, and here it would be kiwi.
41

42
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:05,600
Chunk names are specified here inside the entry point array, actually entry point object, sorry.
42

43
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:16,920
So let's run webpack now and check how many html files we have afterwards.
43

44
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:26,460
Let's go to our editor and check our dist folder one more time.
44

45
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:37,940
And if we look inside dist folder we can see that now we have two html files in our dist folder.
45

46
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:43,670
One html file is kiwi.html, and the other file is hello-world.html. Let's have a look at
46

47
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:50,810
hello-world.html. And here we can see that we have only one css file included here which is 
47

48
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:57,210
hello-world.<something>.css and only one JavaScript file included which is hello-world.<something>.js 
48

49
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:05,480
If we have a look inside our kiwi.html file, we can see that here we also have only one
49

50
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:13,480
css file an only one JavaScript file. So in this video we have learned how we can generate multiple
50

51
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:17,560
html files and include different bundles inside different html files.
