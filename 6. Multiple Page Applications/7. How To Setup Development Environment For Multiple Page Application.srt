In the previous videos we have learned how to set up production configuration for multiple page applications.
1

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:11,250
As a result after every build we are getting several html files for several web pages.
2

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:16,890
Previously in this course we have seen how convenient it is to get fast feedback about our code changes.
3

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:22,520
In this video we will learn how to setup development configuration for multiple page applications.
4

5
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:23,530
Let's go to the webpack.dev.config.js
5

6
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:31,600
and change some things there. First we need to put two entry points instead
6

7
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:39,110
of one. So I will replace this string with a javascript object which we have already seen.
7

8
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,200
And here
8

9
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,300
We'll have only two properties.
9

10
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:49,480
hello-world
10

11
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,100
which will point to our.
11

12
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:55,960
hello-world.js file,
12

13
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,990
and kiwi, which will point to our kiwi.js file.
13

14
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:13,370
Since we have two entry points now we need to adjust our output configuration.
14

15
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:21,730
And I will just add here [name] .
15

16
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:24,690
So now we have output file name
16

17
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:28,510
[name].bundle.js.
17

18
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,020
Now we need to add a second HtmlWebpackPlugin
18

19
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,490
to the list of plugins. Because we have two html pages now. 
19

20
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,890
First I will modify our first entry because we need to change something here.
20

21
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:55,070
We need to specify file name which will be hello-world.html, and we also need to specify chunks
21

22
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,400
which is an array.
22

23
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:03,250
And here we will need a hello-world chunk.
23

24
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:10,410
If you remember the chunk webpack takes from these entry points.
24

25
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:24,250
And here we need to replace our index.hbs with page-template.hbs  because we renamed it before.
25

26
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,350
So now we'll also need a second 
26

27
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,890
HtmlWebpackPlugin here.
27

28
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,260
This one would relate to our kiwi page.
28

29
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:40,070
So I will rename this hello-world to the kiwi
29

30
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,690
And we will also need kiwi chunk.
30

31
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,710
I'll replace title as well as a description.
31

32
00:02:55,460 --> 00:03:02,690
And I believe template is the same because both our html files are using the same page template.
32

33
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:07,790
And basically that's all we need to do.
33

34
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:12,460
We don't need to split common dependencies into a separate bundle because this is the development build
34

35
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:18,130
and all we care about is the speed of the build. Let's run our development build in the terminal and
35

36
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,530
have a look at what we have in the browser
36

37
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:42,030
Webpack tells us that project is running at a http://localhost:9000 so I'll copy
37

38
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:49,210
this url and go to our browser now and I will paste this url into the navigation bar.
38

39
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:58,090
And as we can see there is nothing at our main url now, but we can open different pages using
39

40
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:02,720
different urls. First I will go to our hello-world.html page.
40

41
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:09,000
I will add slash hello-world.html. 
41

42
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:15,440
This is totally the same as the name of our html page that we generated in the dist folder.
42

43
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:23,720
And now we can see that our hello-world page works perfectly. When they click on the button, we see the
43

44
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:32,080
red text appearing.  So let's now check our kiwi page. I will replace hello-world.html with
44

45
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,500
kiwi.html.
45

46
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:41,940
And now we can see that our kiwi page also works. In this video
46

47
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:46,980
we have learned how to set up development configuration for multiple page applications. At this point
47

48
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:52,770
we have fully fledged webpack configurations for both production and development environments specifically
48

49
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,050
targeting multiple page applications.
