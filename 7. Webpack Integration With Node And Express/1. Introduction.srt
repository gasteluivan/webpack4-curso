1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:06,510
At this point we already have a configurations for both single page applications and multiple page applications

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:08,780
as a result of our webpage build.

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,800
We have demo files is all the assets included in the case of a single page application.

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,790
We have only one HMO filed in the case of a multiple page application.

5
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:22,530
We have several HMO files each file corresponds to a page on our website.

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,750
However usually people don't just put HMO files somewhere on the internet when they want to publish

7
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,850
their Web site.

8
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:36,030
Well sometimes they do but in most cases people create some kind of a backend or a web server in order

9
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,530
to serve the content to the users.

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,370
In this section we will learn how to create such a back end and use it for our application.

11
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:49,620
It doesn't matter which technology to use while creating such a backhand you can use no GSM BHP Python

12
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,010
Ruby Java and any other technology of your choice.

13
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,580
In this course we will use energy as an expert as James framework.

14
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:57,770
So let's get started.
