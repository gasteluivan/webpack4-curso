<p>As IÂ said in the previous video, first we will integrate Express framework into a Single Page Application. We will use code from Section 5 as a starting point. You can get this code from the <a href="https://github.com/vp-online-courses/webpack-tutorial" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Github repository</a>. Just follow 3 easy steps:</p><p>1. First, you need to clone this repository to your computer.</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">git clone https://github.com/vp-online-courses/webpack-tutorial.git
cd webpack-tutorial</pre><p>2. Then checkout the branch <code>integrating-express-js-into-a-single-page-application</code>.</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">git checkout -b integrating-express-js-into-a-single-page-application remotes/origin/integrating-express-js-into-a-single-page-application</pre><p>3. Finally, don't forget to reinstall project dependencies after switching to the new branch.</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">rm -rf node_modules
npm install</pre><p>At this point you have all the files you need in order to integrate Express framework into a Single Page Application.</p>
