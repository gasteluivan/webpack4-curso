00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,660
In this video we will learn how to integrate express.js framework into a multiple page application.
1

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,780
It is very similar to what we did with a single page application.
2

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:14,630
But now we need to handle several pages. In this video we will be using code from the Section 6 
3

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:20,240
where we created webpack configuration for a multiple page application. So don't be surprised when you see hello-world.js
4

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,090
and kiwi.js here instead of index .JS file.
5

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,000
Let's go through some of the files we'll use in this video.
6

7
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,810
First let's have a look at the hello world.js.
7

8
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:33,500
You should be already familiar with this file.
8

9
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,350
The only thing here is that we need to remove the line about React.
9

10
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,340
We don't need this line anymore.
10

11
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,370
Now let's have a look at kiwi.js file.
11

12
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:47,340
We have the same line about React here, and we also don't need it here as well.
12

13
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:54,230
We also have server.JS file. We will be using the same code as we did when we talked about single page
13

14
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:58,400
applications. But now we need to handle two pages instead of one.
14

15
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:01,350
So we need to create two routes instead of one.
15

16
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:05,270
First I will change the URL of our existing route to be hello world.
16

17
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:15,860
And I will also change the path to html file to relate to 
17

18
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:16,480
hello world.html.
18

19
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:26,100
Now I will just copy this route and adjust it
19

20
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:32,340
first
20

21
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:42,360
I will change the url to be /kiwi/ and then I will adjust our path to html file to point to the
21

22
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,620
to kiwi.html page.
22

23
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:50,960
we have already installed express.js in the previous videos.
23

24
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:54,630
So here I'll skip this step and that's all we need to do.
24

25
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,910
Let's check now how it works in the browser.
25

26
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,410
But first let's build our application.
26

27
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:18,150
It was a typo there.
27

28
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:26,710
Now I need to start the application. npm start.
28

29
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:29,500
It says that application is running on port 3000.
29

30
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:37,540
So let's go to our browser. and I'll paste a URL in the navigation bar which will be 
30

31
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,570
http://localhost:3000/hello-world/
31

32
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:47,130
and now we get our hello world page here. And it works perfectly.
32

33
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:52,540
And if I change route to be /kiwi/,
33

34
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,390
it will go to our kiwi page.
34

35
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:01,460
It seems everything looks really good. In this video
35

36
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:05,480
we have successfully learned how to handle multiple pages with Express framework.
