<p>In this section (and in the next sections as well) you would need to use <a href="https://github.com/vp-online-courses/webpack-tutorial" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Github repository</a> associated with this course. We'll use the source code from <code>starting-point-for-use-cases</code> branch as a starting point.</p><p>Let me show you how you can get the source code:</p><p>1. First, you need to clone the Github repository.</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">git clone https://github.com/vp-online-courses/webpack-tutorial.git
cd webpack-tutorial</pre><p>2. Second, you need to checkout the branch <code>starting-point-for-use-cases</code>.</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">git checkout -b starting-point-for-use-cases remotes/origin/starting-point-for-use-cases</pre><p>3. Finally, you need to install the project dependencies after switching to the new branch.</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">rm -rf node_modules
npm install</pre><p>Now you are ready to start with this section.</p><p><br></p><p>P. S. You would need to repeat these steps every time you start one of the following sections:</p><p>1. Integration with jQuery.</p><p>2. Integration with Bootstrap.</p><p>3. Using FontAwesome with Webpack.</p><p>4. Using ESLint.</p>
