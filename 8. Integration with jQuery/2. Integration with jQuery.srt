00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:04,640
In this video I'm going to integrate Jake Query into wetback.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:11,100
For those of you quote never use Jake wording this is a fast small and feature reached javascript library.

3
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,790
It can make a lot of things much simpler.

4
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:18,770
For example things like Don't manipulation event handling animation etc..

5
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,980
What's more it works in each and every browser.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,960
I know you can learn more about Jake worry if you go to the website.

7
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:29,760
Jake dot com let's not have a look at our current application.

8
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:32,860
We have a single page application with the heading and a button.

9
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:33,460
Hello world.

10
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:37,150
If I click on the button it displays some text underneath.

11
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:43,490
So far be great that everyone here you when you let jealous creep in this video.

12
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:49,180
I would like to rewrite the hedging component using trickery and then we can compare this to Gordon's

13
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:54,690
first version using when you like Javascript and the second version using J query.

14
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,590
First I need to install Jacquard.

15
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,890
There is a possibility to reinstall January as NPM package

16
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:05,800
now.

17
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:07,070
January is installed.

18
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,990
I am using minus minus safe option because tickler is a production dependency.

19
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:19,240
Now when we have checked were installed let's import it I will go to the in component because I want

20
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,050
to rewrite this component using Jaguar

21
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,950
so no I will import Jan at the top of the file.

22
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,800
Now we have dollar variable imported from Jaguar library.

23
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:47,470
Let's modify the component in order to use a query instead of funny like Javascript so here you go using

24
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:54,850
document create element which is when you like Javascript and I will write it to dollar sign and here

25
00:01:54,850 --> 00:02:01,570
if you need to specify HDMI I'll take each one and these basically is doing the same as document grade

26
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,530
element but it returns and requiring object here.

27
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:11,820
So now we need to rewrite the second line which is document quality selector and these can also replaced

28
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:20,230
with a dollar sign but without this angle brackets so these do search and find a body DOM element inside

29
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,620
our page.

30
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,130
Now let's go to the next line.

31
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:30,880
And here we have each one vote in our demo and these we can rewrite trajectory as well.

32
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:39,670
So each one is a joke very object no and this object has text method so I can write here.

33
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:45,400
Text this is a method and insight I will pass on our stream.

34
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:50,230
And the last line and be also rewritten.

35
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:59,220
Body is I take very object and it has a similar method to apply and child what it is called append and

36
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,950
it basically does absolutely the same as a brand child.

37
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,560
It seems we are done for now.

38
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,640
Let's have a look at our code.

39
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,290
It looks more concise now but still works the same way as before.

40
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,840
Is it better than before.

41
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,360
For some people yes for some people no.

42
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,690
There are pros and cons in each approach use January.

43
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,580
You can write less code and it looks more concise.

44
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:29,190
On the other hand you need to include Jake Query in your javascript bundle and this means additional

45
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,510
85 kilobytes

46
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:38,950
another benefit of Jake worry is that there are tons of security plugins on the internet which can do

47
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,670
everything you can imagine.

48
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:47,130
If you want to use any of these plugins you must have regularly installed.

49
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,230
Now let's run it back and check our page in the browser.

50
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:05,480
As you can see our page still works the same way it is before but now we are using Jacquard.
