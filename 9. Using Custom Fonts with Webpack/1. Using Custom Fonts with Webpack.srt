1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:05,060
In this video you're going to learn how to use custom font with web back.

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:10,740
I'm going to use the single page version of the application as a starting point for this video.

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:17,160
If you want to repeat all the steps on your local computer you would need to clone this repository

4
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,050
and then switch to this branch.

5
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:36,540
Don't forget to run npm install after you switch branches.

6
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,030
Currently we are using default funds for everything on this page.

7
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:47,550
Often times web applications look much better when they utilize custom fonts instead of the default

8
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:48,520
ones.

9
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:53,370
I'm going to overwrite is a default font with some sound more appealing to the users

10
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:05,840
the first link on the Google results page is the right one

11
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,280
on this page you can see houses want.

12
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:18,900
Looks like you can even type here your own text.

13
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:52,070
Now I need to download this font and put it inside my application.

14
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,800
These are the files containing my custom font.

15
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,550
I don't need all of the variations for my application.

16
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,580
I will need only three of them.

17
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:23,410
As you can see all of the files use the F format.

18
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,930
I want to provide a couple of more formats to my customers.

19
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:33,250
There is a website which you can use in order to convert your font to other formats as well.

20
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,900
Here I can choose which formats I need

21
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,020
now.

22
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:56,790
I can drag my font files from my computer

23
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:08,550
next.

24
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:14,680
I'm going to click on the Done button and wait until my font is converted to all of the formats I need

25
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,990
it seems the conversion is done.

26
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,300
Let's download the converted files

27
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,550
here.

28
00:03:55,550 --> 00:04:01,220
We have one variation of our font in three different formats.

29
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:04,300
Let's move these files into our application.

30
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:07,880
I need to create a folder where I'm going to store this fonts

31
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,830
now I can move the a custom font files into this folder

32
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:06,350
next.

33
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:09,650
Let's use this font inside is application.

34
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:13,630
I'm going to make it as a default font for all elements on the page

35
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:22,910
I will create another SPSS file that will affect the whole application

36
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:44,140
in order to tell the browser that we are going to use a custom font.

37
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:52,810
We need to use font face CSA as a rule the font face see essence rule specifies a custom font with which

38
00:05:52,810 --> 00:06:00,970
to display the text by allowing authors to provide their own fonts font face makes it possible to design

39
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:07,740
content without being limited to the so-called Web safe font web safe.

40
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:16,520
Phones are the funds which are so common that they consider it to be universally available.

41
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:19,750
First I need to specify the font family.

42
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:29,260
This would be the name I can use later in order to apply this custom font to various DOM elements.

43
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:33,970
Now I'm going to specify the font weight for this custom font.

44
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:41,490
We have three variations of the same open Sans font but they have different font weight.

45
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:47,850
This property will help us to distinguish between multiple font variations.

46
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:51,040
Now we need to specify the location of the files.

47
00:06:51,190 --> 00:07:15,110
That store is a custom font.

48
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:19,490
I'm going to provide three formats in order to increase browser support

49
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:45,500
had the moment you specified only one font face these font face declares the light font which has font

50
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,760
weight 300.

51
00:07:47,780 --> 00:08:00,200
Now I need to specify two more font faces in order to cover two other font variations.

52
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:02,200
This one will cover font for it.

53
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,150
400

54
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:26,310
and this one will cover font weight six hundred

55
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:39,530
now I need to specify our custom font as the default font

56
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:08,370
the default font it will be 300.

57
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:13,220
Now I need to import this file before any other files in this application

58
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:27,120
there is only one thing left before we are done.

59
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,770
We need to configure repack so it can understand font files.

60
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:39,270
I will go to the VAT pack configuration file in order to load funds I need to add an extra rule to the

61
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,650
wrapper configuration

62
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:50,940
we need to support at least three formats for storing funds.

63
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:21,910
We are going to use a file loader in order to import funds into the project.

64
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:36,770
This will preserve the file name and extension when generating files in the dust folder.

65
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:42,380
This will create a sub folder named funds inside the list folder.

66
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:45,860
I changed the development of a pack configuration.

67
00:10:45,860 --> 00:11:02,280
Now let's add the same rule to the production configuration.

68
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:05,960
Make sure you have the file loader installed.

69
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:11,950
If you followed all the videos you should have it already installed on your computer in case you don't.

70
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:15,470
You just need to run one simple comment from a terminal

71
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,250
that's all.

72
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:34,980
Now let's go to the browser and check if this actually works.

73
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:54,790
As you can see everything works all the text on the page is render it using the custom font we provided.

74
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:59,690
So in this video you have seen how you can use custom fonts with web Westpac.
